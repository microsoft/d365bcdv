# Dataverse Integration Workshop

## Introduction
Integrating w/ Dataverse enables Business Central to interact w/ other apps in its ecosystem, see [a review of Business Central & Dataverse integration](https://github.com/microsoft/d365bcdv/blob/main/Review%20of%20Business%20Central%20and%20Dataverse%20integration.pdf).  There are four types of complementary app/system interactions: Data Sync that replicates data between Business Central & Dataverse, virtual tables on Dataverse via Business Central API for (**C**reate/**R**ead/**U**pdate/**D**elete) operations, data change (**CUD**) events, and business events.

This workshop focuses on those interactions enabled by our virtual table plugin that’s installed on Dataverse: virtual tables, data (CUD) events, and business events.

## Workshop environments & user accounts
For this workshop preparation, we’ve done the following:
- Provisioned a few pairs of Business Central & Dataverse environments
- Run the assisted setup on Business Central app to connect the paired environments
- Installed our virtual table plugin from AppSource on all Dataverse environments
- Generated a few virtual tables (*Customer/Item/Sales Order/Sales Order Line*) to make them visible on all Dataverse environments
- Created several user accounts w/ their respective username/password to perform exercises on the paired environments that are accessible to them, for example creating/configuring model-driven Power Apps, Power Automate flows, and Power Pages sites
- Created several contact accounts w/ their respective username/password to access Power Pages sites that have been created/configured by the above users

To avoid conflicts when performing exercises, each user account has a dedicated company on its Business Central environment.  For example, the user *alans@XXXXXXXXX.OnMicrosoft.com* has been assigned the *SUPER* permission set to access his dedicated *Cronus ALANS* company.  To access the pre-generated/visible virtual tables, each user account has been assigned the *System Administrator* security role on its Dataverse environment.  Each contact account represents a customer of the dedicated company and can access a Power Pages site mapped to that company.  For example, the contact *alan* represents *Adatum Corporation*, which is a customer of *Cronus ALANS* company, and can access the Power Pages site mapped to *Cronus ALANS*.

To reserve your user/contact accounts, enter your name/alias in the "Reserved by" column, next to those accounts that are still available on our [reservation sheet](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Ag4kKioQJdg6gdA0-KhrKmJfd5yNCg?e=r9M7hf) and take note of the same password for all accounts.

Use your reserved user account, preferably in a dedicated browser profile/incognito browser mode, to access the [base app on your Business Central environment](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/), [Power Apps maker portal on your Dataverse environment](https://make.powerapps.com/), [Power Automate maker portal on your Dataverse environment](https://make.powerautomate.com/), and the Power Pages site mapped to your dedicated company in our reservation sheet, so you can perform the following exercises:
