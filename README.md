# Dynamics 365 Business Central & Dataverse integration

This repo is being prepared as our one-stop-shop for Business Central & Dataverse integration that includes all types of app/system interactions, such as Data Sync that replicates data between Business Central & Dataverse, virtual tables on Dataverse via Business Central API for (**C**reate/**R**ead/**U**pdate/**D**elete) operations, data change (**CUD**) events, and business events.

In here, our partners/customers can discuss existing features, preview new ones, try sample code, and submit their feedbacks/questions/issues/ideas, while we can follow up, prioritize, and take them into our roadmap.

Integrating w/ Dataverse enables Business Central to interact w/ other apps in its ecosystem, see [a review of Business Central & Dataverse integration](https://github.com/microsoft/d365bcdv/blob/main/Review%20of%20Business%20Central%20and%20Dataverse%20integration.pdf).  To preview business events, see [Business Events on Business Central (Preview)](https://github.com/microsoft/d365bcdv/tree/main/samples/Business%20Events/Private%20Preview).
